#This program implements the recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n-2) where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2 in three different ways: using a recursive function, an iterative loop, and dynamic programming. The program is written in C and can be compiled and run on any system with a C compiler.

# Development Environment

 - Operating System: Windows 10
 - IDE: Visual Studio Code
 - Compiler: GCC (MinGW-w64)

# How to Compile and Run

  1- Install GCC (MinGW-w64) compiler on your system.
  2- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the "fibonacci.c" file.
  3- Compile the program using the following command:

    
                  gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
  4-Run the program using the following command:

            ./fibonacci
            
The program will output the results of the arithmetic operations and Fibonacci sequence to the console.
